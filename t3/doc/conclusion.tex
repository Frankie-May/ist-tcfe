\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The final objective of this laboratory was to create an AC/DC converter.
To achieve this objective we made use of a transformer and two sub-circuits, a envelop detector and a voltage regulator.
With the final results obtained, we can conclude that the objective was achieved and we were able to convert alternate current to direct current
