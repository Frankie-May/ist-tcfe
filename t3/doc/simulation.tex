\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

To simulate the AC/DC converter we use two sub-circuits, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.
The transformer is simulated solely by dividing the input voltage amplitude by the value of turns in the transformer. We then use a voltage source connected to the main circuit which has an amplitude of $V_in/n$ and the same frequency.
The envelope detector used consists in a full wave bridge rectifier in series with a capacitor and a resistance, in order to reduce ripple and control the voltage drops. This creates a less rippled wave, although its DC value is still very high.
To further reduce ripple and the DC component value, we use a voltage regulator circuit, consisting in a resistance in series with 17 diodes.
This not only reduces the envelop detector output voltage's DC component to approximately $12V$ but also greatly reduces ripple.
The voltage regulator output is now approximately only direct current.
