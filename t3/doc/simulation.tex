\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

The circuit that we have created is going to be simulated using a circuit simulation platform, Ngspice. The circuit is described using ngspice notation and the operating point analysis was done. The values of the parameters of the circuit are presented in the table \ref{tab:op}.

We firstly started by writing the script to simulate the AC/DC converter for 10 periods, using the defeault diode model. Then, the output voltage level is measured \ref{gr√°f?}, as well as the voltage output ripple \ref[something}.

The voltages at the output of the envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits were then plotted, as shown in \ref{umplotqq}
