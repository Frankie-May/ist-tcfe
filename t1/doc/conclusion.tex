\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory experiment, we aimed to calculate the parameters that define the circuit, which are the voltages in each node and the currents in each branch.
Using Octave to help us in theoretical analysis and with resource to Ngspice simulation software we were able to analyse the proposed circuit.

This analysis proved to be congruent and plausible after comparing the different results obtained from Ngspice and theoretical analysis (Octave). This results ended up being similar, which can be explained by the straight-forwardness of the circuit, that contains only linear components, and the Nodes' and Meshes' Methods precision.

If the components that constitute the circuit were more complex and weren't described by linear equations it would be expected that the values for the voltages and the currents obtained by the simulation would differ from the ones calculated using a theoretical analysis.

Overall, with the data obtained, we can conclude that the objective of this laboratory work was successfully accomplished.
