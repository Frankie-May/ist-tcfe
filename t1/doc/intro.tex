\section{Introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing the following components: seven resistors, one independent voltage source, one independent current source, one voltage controlled current source and one current controlled voltage source, grouped in four meshes. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{Fig1: circuit}

We will start by making a theoretical analysis of the circuit, first by  using the Meshes' Method, in which we’ll look at the circuit’s four meshes, calculating each mesh’s current; and by making a nodal analysis of it, determining the voltage between nodes.

After that, the circuit will be analysed by simulation, whose results will be compared to the theoretical ones in section~\ref{sec:analysis}.

Conclusions from this laboratory are presented in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
