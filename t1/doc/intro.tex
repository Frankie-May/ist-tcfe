\section{Introduction}
\label{sec: introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing two sinusoidal voltage sources, seven resistors, and two controlled voltage sources, grouped in four loops. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{Fig1: circuit}

We will start by making a theoretical analysis of the circuit, first by  using the mesh method, in which we’ll look at the circuit’s four meshes, calculating each mesh’s current; and by making a nodal analysis of it, determining the voltage between nodes.
After that, the circuit will be analysed by simulation, whose results will be compared to the theoretical ones.
