\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

The circuit that we have analysed through the mesh and the node method is going to be simulated using a circuit simulation platform, Ngspice. This program allows you to use simple notation to represent the circuit components and through the indication of the nodes that the components are connected to, it's able to compute the voltages and the currents that characterise the circuit.

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the results of the operating point analysis (steady-state analysis) that is given by the simulator for the circuit that is being studied.
