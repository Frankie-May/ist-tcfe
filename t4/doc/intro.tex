\section{Introduction}

This laboratory main objective is to conceive an Audio Amplifier Circuit. The converter consists in two sub-circuits, a gain stage and a output stage, as seen in figure \ref{Fig1: circuit}.

To build this circuit we have to maximise the merit. The merit of the work is given by:
\begin{equation}
    Merit = \dfrac{voltageGain \times bandwidth}{cost \times lowerCutoffFreq}
\end{equation}

We also need to build the circuit as cheap as we can. Both \SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}, in a resistance, and \SI{1}{\micro\farad}, in a capacitor, cost 1 Monetary Unit (MU). The other element used is a transistor which costs 0.1 MU per unit.
With this price table we can compute the cost
\begin{equation}
    Cost = N_{transistors}*0.1+N_{Resistances}*1+N_{Capacitors}*1
\end{equation}
To achieve this we will be using a degenerated common emitter amplifier for the gain stage circuit and a degenerated common collector amplifier circuit for output stage circuit. The gain stage also features a bias circuit, in order to assure the transistor's activation.
