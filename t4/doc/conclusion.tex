The cost of the circuit is the following:
\begin{equation}
Cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of transistors
\end{equation}
Adding in the values, we get=
\begin{equation}
Cost = 
\end{equation}


The merit of the work is the following:
\begin{equation}
Merit = (Voltage Gain * bandwith) / (cost * lower cut freq)
\end{equation}
Adding in the values, we get=
\begin{equation}
Merit = 
\end{equation}

The final objective of this laboratory was to create an AC/DC converter.
To achieve this objective we made use of a transformer and two sub-circuits, a envelop detector and a voltage regulator.
With the final results obtained, we can conclude that the objective was achieved and we were able to convert alternate current to direct current
