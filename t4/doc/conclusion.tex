With the obtained results, and although they may differ due to reasons explained in the previous sections, and even though our merit is not very high, we can say that the objective of the work was accomplished and we were able to amplify an input signal wave through a circuit composed by transistors, resistances and capacitor's.

The following figure shows the input signal and its output signal, with a phase shift.
