\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The cost of the circuit is the following:
\begin{equation}
Cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of transistors
\end{equation}

The quality of the circuit is the following:
\begin{equation}
Quality = 1/(7.50135*10^{-2}) + 1/(1.202401*10^{1}) = 13.41410
\end{equation}

The merit of the work is the following:
\begin{equation}
Merit = (Voltage Gain * bandwith) / (cost * lower cut freq)
\end{equation}

The final objective of this laboratory was to create an AC/DC converter.
To achieve this objective we made use of a transformer and two sub-circuits, a envelop detector and a voltage regulator.
With the final results obtained, we can conclude that the objective was achieved and we were able to convert alternate current to direct current
