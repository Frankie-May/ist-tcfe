\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory experiment, we aimed to calculate the parameters that define the circuit, which are the voltages in each node and the currents in each branch.
Using Octave to help us in theoretical analysis and with resource to Ngspice simulation software we were able to analyse the proposed circuit.

This analysis proved to be congruent and plausible after comparing the different results obtained from Ngspice and theoretical analysis (Octave). This results ended up being similar, which can be explained by the not much complexity of the circuit, even though there are some errors due to its alternated current when $T>=0$ which can produce some noise in the simulation and involve more calculations and some iterations in the theoretical analysis.

Overall, with the data obtained, we can conclude that the objective of this laboratory work was successfully accomplished.
