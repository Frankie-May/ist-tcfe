\section{Introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit shown on image \ref{Fig1: circuit}

We will start by making a theoretical analysis of the circuit, first by  using the Meshes' Method, in which we’ll look at the circuit’s four meshes, calculating each mesh’s current; and by making a nodal analysis of it, determining the voltage between nodes.

After that, the circuit will be analysed by simulation, whose results will be compared to the theoretical ones in section~\ref{sec:analysis}.

Conclusions from this laboratory are presented in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
