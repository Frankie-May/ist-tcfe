\section{Introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study the circuit shown on image \ref{Fig1: circuit}

We will start by making a theoretical analysis of the circuit, using mostly the Nodal method and concepts such as impedance and complex representation of voltage.

After that, the circuit will be analysed by simulation, whose results will be compared to the theoretical ones in section~\ref{sec:analysis}.

Side by side tables are also presented

Conclusions from this laboratory are presented in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
