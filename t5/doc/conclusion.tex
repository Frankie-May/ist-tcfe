With the obtained results, very similar either in the simulation and the theoretical analysis, we can say that the objective of the work was accomplished and we were able to amplify an input signal wave and select a specified frequency through a circuit composed by an OP-AMP (Operational Amplifier), resistances and capacitors. The obtained merit is not very big, but it was not possible to reduce it much more due to the high OPAMP cost and the limited number of resistors and capacitors we could have used. Even so, the merit is pretty reasonable.
