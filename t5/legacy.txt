This file contains legacy values for the circuit filter's resistance and capacitance
and can be used in order to validate the models used in our laboratory assignement. This values could
not be used in the laboratory due to the restrictions imposed by the number of resistors and capacitors
we could use and by the resistance and capacitance each of these components had.

In order to use these values we must change them manually in the three following files:

	mat/t5.m
	sim/t5.net
	sim/outputimpedance.net

The variables names differ from the .m and the .net files, therefore the first variable name is the variable
name in the .net files and the second name is the variable name in the .m file.

---------------------
| .net |  .m | value|
|Ri_val|Rlcut| 2.4e3|
|Ci_val|Clcut|1e-6  |
|Ro_val|Rhcut|0.01e3|
|Co_val|Chcut| 1e-6 |
---------------------

.net files: Change values in the top parameters
Example: .param Ci_val = %value%;

.m files: Change values in the top variable declaration and inside the transfer function
(use find [CTRL+F] to make it easier)

Example: Clcut = %value%;


With these values we maximized merit as much we could and had really small gain and frequency deviations.
The merit wass low due to the high cost imposed by the OPAMP.
